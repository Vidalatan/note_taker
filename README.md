# Note Taker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

A lightweight application to allow you to write, save, and reload notes. It is intended to have this application hosted on some form of platform (at the time of writing this: 'Heroku'). This 'Note Taker' app also has the ability to delete notes that are no longer useful. 

This project uses [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to create prompts, and [edit-json-file](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/edit-json-file) to allow quick and easy modification of the db.json file.
